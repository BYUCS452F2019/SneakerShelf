# SneakerShelf
Displays your shelf of sneakers and when you last wore them

# Problem
I have too many pairs of shoes, but I don't want any pair to be sitting on the shelf for too long without being used. I figured putting some data behind the problem would be the best way make sure that no one pair is getting worn too often (don't want to be called out by any sneakerheads) and no pair is lanquishing in the dark.

Relational Database: postgreSQL or mySQL
NoSQL Database: MongoDB (open to other ideas)
Frontend: Angular8

# Business
No real business plan behind this. You could possibly monetize by having ads at the bottom of the screen if you want to compromise the user experience in that way. Otherwise, you could have a limit for number of shoes for a free tier or offer additional capabilities (such as looking at the weather to suggest shoes) on a subscription basis.

# Legal
Ideally next to no user data would be stored, we could use a Google Account sign-in to turn authentication over to someone else. That way only a username would really be required to match with the user on the return from an authentication request.
